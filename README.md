# ffmpeg-templates
The ffmpeg template batch files that i use to bulk convert stuff

# So, how do i use them?
You have to [download ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows) and then add the executable to your environment variable. Then you simply drag your video files to the related folders and run the batch file. Checking out what those batch files do and modifying them to your needs is encouraged and will step down the learning curve as well. Happy batching!
